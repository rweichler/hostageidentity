# Hostage Identity

My last, and most ambitious, GMod addon. Stopped development in October 2008.

This was supposed to be a 1-to-1 clone of Counter-Strike, but in GMod. The goal was that the whole game would be written in Lua, so that it would be customizable by anyone. A truly democratic game.

Unfortunately, my ambitions were too high. Turns out GMod has a lot of unfixable issues and limitations; something like this just isn't possible in a game like that (GMod being closed source being the main one). At the time, I thought I just wasn't good enough at coding.

I guess this repo is the rawest expression of my motivations. Being unable to complete this gamemode made me lose all interest in GMod (and programming in general) for a long time. If I didn't discover cycript/mobilesubstrate and the non-sandboxed iOS scene, then I probably would have thought a game like this is impossible. But it isn't.  I'll consider my work done when I manage to complete something like this.
